      <p> <h3>By now you have heard about the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">Coronavirus</a></h3>  </p>
      <p><h3>The sad reality is that it is spreading quickly and will continue to spread for a while.</h3></p>
      <h3>Did you know that we are getting roughly <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">13,000 new cases a day and it’s growing fast?</a></h3>
<h3>No one really knows how many people will be infected (or will pass away sadly), but it has caused the global stock markets to crash, which means as a business (or even a marketer), you will be affected.</h3>
<h3>And because <a href="https://npdigital.com/">my ad agency </a> works with hundreds of companies in all the major sectors and we have 7 offices around the world, we are already starting to see how it is impacting marketing (I’ll share the data below). </h3>
<h3>So what does this mean for you?

<p>Well, before I go into that, let me be clear on what marketers should NOT do.</p></h3>
